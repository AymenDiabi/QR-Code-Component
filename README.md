# QR-Code-Component
- This is a challenge that i took from Frontend Mentor to hone my skills and practice on HTML &amp; CSS
- I made this challenge using pure HTML & CSS, i used the png. file to make it and tried to make it as close to the design as possible
- The challenge is a QR Card Component and when you scan it, it takes you to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) website
- What i added to this component is a hover effect, so whenever you hover on the card, the QR Code zooms in
